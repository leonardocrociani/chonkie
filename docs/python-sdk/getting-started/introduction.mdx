Ever found yourself making a RAG pipeline yet again (your 2,342,148th one), only to realize you're stuck having to write chunking with bloated software library X or the painfully feature-less library Y?
_WHY CAN'T THIS JUST BE SIMPLE, UGH?_

Well, look no further than Chonkie! (chonkie boi is a gud boi 🦛)

## Quick Start

Get started with Chonkie in three simple steps: Install, Import and CHONK!

```bash
pip install chonkie
```

Want more features? <Tooltip tip="Not recommended for production">Install everything</Tooltip>:
```bash
pip install chonkie[all]
```

<Note>
  Chonkie follows a special approach to dependencies, keeping the base installation lightweight while allowing you to add extra features as and when needed.
  Please check the [Installation](/installation) page for more details.
</Note>

Release the CHONK! 🦛✨

```python
# First import the chunker you want from Chonkie 
from chonkie import TokenChunker

# Initialize the chunker
chunker = TokenChunker() # defaults to using GPT2 tokenizer

# Here's some text to chunk
text = """Woah! Chonkie, the chunking library is so cool!"""

# Chunk some text
chunks = chunker(text)

# Access chunks
for chunk in chunks:
    print(f"Chunk: {chunk.text}")
    print(f"Tokens: {chunk.token_count}")
```
