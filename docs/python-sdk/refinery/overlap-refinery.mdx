The `OverlapRefinery` enhances chunks by incorporating context from neighboring chunks. This is useful for tasks where maintaining contextual continuity between chunks is important, such as question answering or summarization over long documents. It can add context as a prefix (from the preceding chunk) or a suffix (from the next chunk).

## API Reference
To use the `OverlapRefinery` via the API, check out the [API reference documentation](../../api-reference/overlap-refinery).

## Initialization

To use the `OverlapRefinery`, initialize it with the desired parameters. You can specify a tokenizer, context size, overlap mode, method, and other options.

```python
from chonkie import OverlapRefinery

# Initialize with default character-level overlap (25% context size)
overlap_refinery = OverlapRefinery()

# Initialize with a specific tokenizer and context size
overlap_refinery_token = OverlapRefinery(
    tokenizer_or_token_counter="gpt2", # Can be string identifier, callable, or Tokenizer instance
    context_size=0.25,                 # The size of the context to add to the chunks.
    method="prefix",                   # Add context from the previous chunk
    merge=True                         # Merge context directly into chunk text
)

# Initialize for recursive overlap based on rules
from chonkie import RecursiveRules, RecursiveLevel
rules = RecursiveRules(
    levels=[
        RecursiveLevel(delimiters=["\n\n"], include_delim="prev"),
        RecursiveLevel(delimiters=["."], include_delim="prev"),
        RecursiveLevel(whitespace=True)
    ]
)
overlap_refinery_recursive = OverlapRefinery(
    tokenizer_or_token_counter="gpt2",
    context_size=0.25,
    mode="recursive",
    rules=rules,
    method="suffix"
)
```

## Usage

Use the `OverlapRefinery` object as a callable or use the `refine` method to add overlapping context to your chunks.

```python
from chonkie import TokenChunker, OverlapRefinery

test_string = "This is the first sentence. This is the second sentence, providing context. This is the third sentence, which needs context from the second."
chunker = TokenChunker()
chunks = chunker(test_string)

# Initialize refinery to add suffix overlap
overlap_refinery = OverlapRefinery(
    tokenizer_or_token_counter="gpt2",
    context_size=0.5,
    method="suffix",
    merge=True
)

refined_chunks = overlap_refinery(chunks)
```

## Parameters

<ParamField
    path="tokenizer_or_token_counter"
    type="Union[str, Callable, Any]"
    default='"character"'
>
    The tokenizer or token counter to use for calculating overlap size. Can be a string identifier (e.g., "gpt2"), a callable, or a `chonkie.Tokenizer` instance. Defaults to character counting.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
    path="context_size"
    type="Union[int, float]"
    default="0.25"
>
    The size of the overlap context. If an `int`, it's the absolute number of tokens. If a `float` (between 0 and 1), it's the fraction of the maximum chunk token count.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
    path="mode"
    type='Literal["token", "recursive"]'
    default='"token"'
>
    The mode for calculating overlap. `"token"` uses the tokenizer directly. `"recursive"` uses hierarchical splitting based on `rules`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
    path="method"
    type='Literal["suffix", "prefix"]'
    default='"suffix"'
>
    The method for adding context. `"suffix"` adds context from the *next* chunk to the end of the current chunk. `"prefix"` adds context from the *previous* chunk to the beginning of the current chunk.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
    path="rules"
    type="RecursiveRules"
    default="RecursiveRules()"
>
    The rules used for splitting text when `mode` is `"recursive"`. Defines delimiters and behavior at different hierarchical levels. See `chonkie.types.RecursiveRules`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
    path="merge"
    type="bool"
    default="True"
>
    If `True`, the calculated context is directly prepended (for `prefix`) or appended (for `suffix`) to the `chunk.text`. If `False`, the context is stored in `chunk.context` attribute without modifying `chunk.text`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField
    path="inplace"
    type="bool"
    default="True"
>
    If `True`, modifies the input list of chunks directly. If `False`, returns a new list of modified chunks.
</ParamField>
