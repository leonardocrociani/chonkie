# 🦛 Chonkie Docs ✨

</div>

> chonkie was just fine with a single DOCS.md! do we have to do this? UGH

Chonkie was built with the principle of being so simple that the documentation would be minimal. However, as we grow, we need to add more documentation to help users understand the different chunking strategies available to them. So here we are!

## Incorrect Documentation?

If you find any incorrect documentation, please open an issue or submit a PR to fix it. You can:

1. [Open an issue](https://github.com/bhavnicksm/chonkie/issues/new) describing the problem
2. [Edit the docs directly](https://github.com/bhavnicksm/chonkie/tree/main/docs) and submit a pull request
3. Use the "Suggest an edit" button at the bottom of any documentation page

For pull requests, please:

- Clearly describe what you're fixing
- Reference any related issues
- Follow the existing documentation style
- Test any code examples you modify

We appreciate your help in keeping our documentation accurate and up-to-date!
